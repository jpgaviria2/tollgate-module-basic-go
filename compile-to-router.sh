# compile-to-router.sh - Build and deploy tollgate-wrt binary to OpenWrt router
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Development/debugging tool for quickly testing changes on a router.
#   NOT intended for official deployments or production use.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   This script cross-compiles both the TollGate service and CLI client for the target
#   router architecture and deploys them via SSH/SCP. It handles the service
#   lifecycle by stopping the service before deployment and restarting it after.
#   Designed for rapid iteration during development and debugging.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./compile-to-router.sh [ROUTER_IP] [OPTIONS]
#
# ARGUMENTS:
#   ROUTER_IP (optional)    - IP address of the target router
#                            Format: X.X.X.X (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
#                            Default: 192.168.1.1
#                            Must be the first argument if provided
#
# OPTIONS:
#   --device=DEVICE        - Target device model for architecture selection
#                           Supported values:
#                           - gl-mt3000 (ARM64 architecture) [default]
#                           - gl-mt6000 (ARM64 architecture - MediaTek Filogic)
#                           - gl-ar300 (MIPS with soft float)
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   ./compile-to-router.sh                                    # Deploy to 192.168.1.1 for gl-mt3000
#   ./compile-to-router.sh 192.168.1.100                     # Deploy to custom IP for gl-mt3000
#   ./compile-to-router.sh --device=gl-mt6000                # Deploy to 192.168.1.1 for gl-mt6000
#   ./compile-to-router.sh 192.168.1.100 --device=gl-mt6000  # Custom IP and device
#   ./compile-to-router.sh --device=gl-ar300                 # Deploy to 192.168.1.1 for gl-ar300
#   ./compile-to-router.sh 192.168.1.100 --device=gl-ar300  # Custom IP and device
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - Go compiler installed and configured
#   - SSH access to the router (uses root user)
#     * For password-less deployment, set up SSH keys: ssh-copy-id root@router_ip
#   - Router must have the tollgate-basic service configured
